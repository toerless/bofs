Coordinating Agent To Agent List of efforts (CATALIST)

## Description 

Non-WG-Forming effort to determine the needs of the community regarding AI & Agent related IETF work that is cross area or working group.

Over the last few IETF meetings there have been a considerable number of side meetings focused on agent-to-agent communications (especially for AI agents). 
It was hard for IETF participants to follow all of these meetings especially considering conflicts with the regular IETF agendas.

This BoF provides an opportunity to:

- Briefly summarize the ecosystem, including work happening outside of the IETF, at W3C, 3GPP, and the Linux Foundation.
- Briefly summarize work that is happening in IETF side meetings that is progressing on mailing lists.
- Specifically DMSC and AIProto.
- Answer questions like what work should be pursued in the IETF?
- Identify and share existing IETF WGs that are already addressing some of the use cases tangent to agent communication.

CATALIST is explicitly not intended to pick between competing proposals, nor to prematurely define any end-to-end agent communication protocols. 
Instead, the meeting will provide a forum to share information about these efforts and to offer the community an ability to see if any kind of recurring meeting is useful for coordination purposes or not.

Note that this BoF is not intended to squelch discussions at side meetings which can continue to be useful to develop and discuss ideas in detail. 
The meeting is meant to provide a high level overview, and to figure out what would be helpful to the IETF community regarding trends in AI & Agent communication.

This BoF is not for AI Proto or DMSC, it is for discussing the overall ecosystem and the needs of the community.

## Information for IAB/IESG

Several recent side meetings discussed Agent-to-Agent communication, including the following from IETF 123 and 124 
IETF123: https://trello.com/b/6kmZPwOx/ietf-123-side-meeting-scheduling
IETF124: https://trello.com/b/s1hNprRf/ietf-124-side-meeting-scheduling

Mailing lists discussing AI & Agent communication:
- https://mailman3.ietf.org/mailman3/lists/agent2agent@ietf.org/
- https://mailman3.ietf.org/mailman3/lists/dmsc@ietf.org/

We suggest the session be held as earlier as possible in the week, as several questions raised will be discussed during side meetings during IETF 125.

## Relevant I-Ds and Links

There is a discussion mailing list at agent2agent@ietf.org. 
This list discusses possible areas for standardization related to AI agents. 
The list might result in proposing a BoF, a side meeting or an IAB Workshop. 
See the IETF 124 side meeting schedule for examples of the kind of work that is being discussed: https://trello.com/b/s1hNprRf/ietf-124-side-meeting-scheduling

Further links to be added depending on agenda items, but see list of prior work above.

We will also work on creating a wiki.ietf.org page for tracking the coordination effort. 

This will provide a shared repository where proponents of related initiatives can briefly summarise their work and link to the relevant home pages, key documents, and other supporting information (e.g., drafts, GitHub repositories, mailing lists, and slide decks).
